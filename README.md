I have seen my father always frustrated about the login info's to many websites.It is frustrating for me also to remember all these passwords and login info.
Although many password managers are there but they are kinda of unreliable as they save passwords on servers.

## Solution
So here I am trying to build this software which stores the login info locally on your device and whenever you need it you can access them using your phone password or your fingerprint(as in apple).
